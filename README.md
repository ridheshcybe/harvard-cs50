# Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridheshcybe/harvard-cs50.git && cd ./harvard-cs50/server && npm install && node .
```

This is a server that hosts notes made by <a href="https://github.com/ridheshcybe">Ridhesh w.</a>

We use 4 modules (2 native) in nodejs.

The 2 packages used natively are fs (for file loading) and path (for directory path resolving).

The other packages are express (for hosting a server) and ejs (for file rendering).
