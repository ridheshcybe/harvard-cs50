游릴h2游린 RGB

Standard way of describing photo bits

# hex code
XX => red;
YY => green;
ZZ => blue;

#XXYYZZ

游릴h2游린 Hexadecimal 
from 0-9 A-f;
example => 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F

游릴h4游린 Suppose red;

16^10 16
X     X;

combined => XX
Max of combined => 256

Each letter is 4 bits long
therefore XX is 1 byte (8 bits)

Now try address of a int

游릴CODE_5_addresses游린

Pointer is just a integer that represents a value in the memory

the string.h module contains the pointer to the start of the string
the return value of a string type is the pointer to the null value of the string

Example:
游릴CODE_5_ad-str游린

removing the training wheels
游릴CODE_5_ad-char游린

typedef enables to create data types
游릴CODE_5_type游린

游릴h2游린 Pointer arithmetic (Math on addresses)

游릴CODE_5_ad-math游린

now compareing strings

游릴CODE_5_compare游린

copy string

游릴CODE_5_copy游린

NULL is at the start address of a computer

Now with valgrind
